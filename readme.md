# Spatial programming with transformation goals

a transformation can be required to be Lossless or Lossy

visual, spatial combination of transformation goal blocks. 
automatic generation of steps from block A to block B. 

when i go to a bakery, how do i know i get what i want?
A) i recognize a solution behind the counter
B) i speak the same language as the clerk, so i describe my problem, and trust him to deliver the solution

any program needs to be able to look at data, determine if it recognizes the data, and be able to parse it. 

when coding, i want to be able to say, "this is my <2d float vector>. i want to <rotate> it.". 
my IDE should find a function which uses the correct data type, and imports the relevant function from a global library. 

next step is doing this visually & spatially, with blocks that describe goals.


_program A
goal: draw something cool based on user input
constraints: _
as in: transform <any user input> into <physical print>
this means:
program A needs to find
a program that transforms <any user input> into <any type X>
a program that transforms <any type X> into <svg data>
a program that transforms <svg data> into <physical print>


_program B
goal: recommend a movie to user based on which movies the user likes
constraints: _
as in: transform <favorite movie name string> into <recommended movie name string>
this means:
program A needs 


_program C
goal: solve a math problem
constraints: _
as in: transform <math problem string> into <solution string>


_program D
goal: add two integers
constraints: Z is the sum of X and Y
as in: transform <integer X, integer Y> into <integer Z>





goal-oriented programs that figure out how to communicate with other programs, based on what the goal is

1. coding -> direct manipulation of data

2. procedures -> goals and constraints

3. text dump -> spatial representations

4. sequential -> concurrent
